# Projects

This is a repository where I upload the code of some of the projects I'm working on. The documentation for each project can be found in the READMEs in the respective folders. (_TODO_)  
All of this is still work in progress.  

Currently, the only Project here is an ESP8266 "Control Pannel":  
It's a web interface with toggle switches that control the outputs of the ESP. It can be used to switch on and off lights and relays for home automation, for example.  
One version uses HTTP requests, and the other uses the WebSocket protocol.  
The WebSocket version has much lower latency, but it's a little more complicated. 

I hope some of you will find this useful for your own projects.
